<p align="left" >Some time ago I watched a series in which a raven was an animal that was used for observation. It stared at the target 
carefully as if it wanted to see all the details and potential clues. For those interested, there were also vampires and werewolves 
in the series (probably many of you already guess what the series is about). I recently remembered this and read a bit about it, 
even found out that ravens are considered animals that can be tracked by military and governmental organizations. Hence the idea to name 
the library whose core will be based on the observer pattern as Raven. An additional advantage of this approach is easy understanding of the context and purpose, I would like this library to be able to describe what it does, and this approach is also evident in the interfaces and approach to using the framework. I believe that basing the elements of logic that is visible in the code on elements that are visible in the natural environment, the principles of operation should be easier to understand
